    "### Directions\n",
    "In the code cell below, write Python code to accomplish the following using what you've learned through Chapter 2. Prompt the user to enter a whole dollar amount (from 1 - 99 for this application) to be withdrawn from our virtual ATM. Use the input gathering techniques demonstrated in Section 2.6 to gather this input. For the moment, you may assume that the user follows your directions for the input (namely, entering an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive). Calculate and print the number of bills of each denomination (twenties, tens, fives, and ones) that should be dispensed, minimizing the total number of bills used. Start with twenties and work your way down to ones. If no bills of a particular denomination are needed, skip that bill in the output using `if` statements as demonstrated in Section 2.7 of the text. (25 pts.)\n",
    "### Sample Output\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
