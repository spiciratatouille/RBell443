    "Write a Python code fragment in the code cell below that defines a function named `classify_hurricane` that accepts a hurricane's wind speed (an integer) as a parameter and prints its category on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale classifies hurricanes into five categories numbered 1 through 5. Category 5 hurricanes have sustained winds of at least 157 miles per hour. The minimum sustained wind speeds for categories 4 through 1 are 130, 111, 96, and 74 miles per hour, respectively. Any storm with winds of less than 74 miles per hour is not a hurricane. Your function should output __Category X__ where __X__ is from 1-5 or __Not a hurricane__ if the wind speed passed is less than 74 miles per hour. Test the function with several wind speeds. Strive for code that is clear and efficient. (__8 pts.__)"

    "Write a Python code fragment in the code cell below that implements a simple substitution cipher known as `rot13`. This cipher encrypts a message by rotating the plaintext character by 13 positions in the alphabet.  For example, 'a' becomes 'n' and likewise 'n' becomes 'a'. The nice thing about `rot13` is that the same function can be used to encrypt and decrypt a message. Write a function called `rot13` that takes a message as a parameter (a string) and rotates all the characters by 13 places returning the encrypted/decrypted string. Test with the string 'Hello There!', which should encode as 'uryyb gurer!'. The function should first transform the passed message to lowercase before attempting the rotation. Any character that is not a letter should not be rotated at all (preserving spaces and other punctuation). Strive for code that is clear and efficient. (__8 pts.__)\n",
